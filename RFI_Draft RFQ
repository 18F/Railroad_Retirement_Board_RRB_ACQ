## 1.0 Background and Purpose

### 1.1 Purpose

The U.S. Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) is an independent agency in the executive

branch of the federal government. The RRB's primary function is to administer

comprehensive retirement-survivor annuities and unemployment-sickness benefits for

the nation's railroad workers and their families, under the Railroad Retirement and

Railroad Unemployment Insurance Acts. As part of the retirement program, the RRB

has administrative responsibilities under the Social Security Act for certain benefit

payments and railroad workers' Medicare coverage.

RRB is seeking a contractor to assist with the development of new Citizen Centric

Online Self-Services (CCOSS) applications. Further explanation of CCOSS applications

can be found in sections 1.3 (Problem) and 2.3 (Products).

### 1.2	Background 

#### 1.2.1 Citizen Centric Online Self-Services (CCOSS) Program Overview 

For our railroad retirees, annuitants, and active employees, a customer base of over

675,000, to update personal information such as address or direct deposit, or applying

for sickness benefits requires struggling through a time-consuming process. Users face

long wait call times, inconvenient office visits, or mail delays, with no option of checking

their status requests online.

RRB aims to mitigate these issues by transforming major services for our customers

from phone and paper to the internet, that will reduce staff and customer resources

which are now required to access finances and benefits.

RRB envisions creating the following new applications:

* Direct Deposit Change,

* Change of Address,

* Tax Withholding Change,

* Sickness Application,

* Public User Interface Improvements, and

* Customer 360 Views.

This collection of applications will be referred to as "CCOSS Applications" within this

document. It is required that the underlying code is understood, maintained, and

potentially changed based on the agreed upon direction for modernizing CCOSS

Applications.

#### 1.2.2 Application Development and Modernization Overview

The challenge is the lack of online self-services for railroad employees and their

beneficiaries, such as submitting sickness applications or updating personal

information. We will initially focus on the customer's ability to update personal

information such as the address, direct deposit, and tax form information. Additionally,

we will tackle the customer's ability to submit online sickness applications.

The solution is to provide our customers online self-services to conveniently and

effectively complete simple updates. The most frequent customer requests which the

customer can complete themselves will be tackled first. By our customers using online

self-services, our RRB staff will be able to spend more time addressing more complex

issues which cannot be solved by the customer using self-service applications. This will

also allow RRB staff to tackle and reduce backlogs with the goal of backlog elimination.

Successful implementation of this project will impact our entire customer base of over

675,000 annuitants and applicants and improve internal workloads. Results will include

our customer's digital online ability to update personal data, such as address, direct

deposit, tax form information, and sickness applications; this will be an instantaneous

improvement in customer experience (CX) over the current method of traditional mail.

By increasing self-service capabilities to annuitants and applicants, we expect the

current average of 40-minute call wait times to decrease significantly, which will afford

our staff, specifically claims representatives, opportunities to provide improved, in-depth

services for more complex customer requests, such as retirement counseling or issues

with payments.

In addition, we anticipate that this project will streamline core RRB business processes

and improve service delivery to annuitants and applicants by providing more efficient

claims processing and reduced processing times.

MyRRB is the current web portal (link: [myRRB | RRB.Gov](https://rrb.gov/Benefits/myRRB)) that provides access to
RRB’s online services for Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) and Railroad
Retirement Act (RRA) user community of beneficiaries and annuitants. Online services
currently available through the myRRB web portal include the following:

● apply for and claim unemployment benefits,

● claim sickness benefits,

● access RUIA tax documents,

● view service and compensation,

● obtain retirement benefits estimates,

● request documents to be mailed (i.e. Medicare card, duplicate tax statements, monthly rate verification letter, service and compensation record), and

● pay bills for unemployment/Sickness, retirement/survivor, and Medicare debts.

### 1.3	Problem

For our railroad retirees, annuitants, and active employees (a customer base of over 675,000) to update personal information such as address or direct deposit or applying for sickness benefits requires struggling through a time-consuming process. To make requests, customers face long wait call times, inconvenient office visits, or mail delays, with no option of checking their status requests online.

Due to the lack of efficient online self-services, manual resources are drained: call volumes are very high; response rates are extremely low; and processing simple actions takes time that could be spent on more complicated requests. Currently, the RRB depends upon paper-based services, which exceeds $2M annually in mailing processing costs and average turnaround time for application processing is 35 days.

We expect that these costs and processing times will greatly diminish with the expansion of online services to include the ability for customers to access self-service applications. The primary intent of this effort is to provide a better customer experience. RRB wants to increase the number of services offered in the myRRB web portal.

### 1.4	Existing RRB Systems

Existing RRB systems use the following languages, platforms, development tools, and databases:

- Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL)

- C#/VB.Net

- Classic Active Server Pages (ASP)

- dBase

- Visual Basic 6.0 (VB6)

- Microsoft Access

- .NET Framework

- Visual Studio 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019

- IBM Database 2 (DB2)

- Microsoft SQL

- IBM zOS Cloud

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)

- Azure Cloud

RRB has 75+ mainframe and non-mainframe applications supporting RRA and RUIA benefit systems (Refer to Appendix 1).

RRB uses Login.gov (<https://www.login.gov/what-is-login/>) for secure login services for the public to access the myRRB web portal. Once end users verify their identity through login.gov they are able to access the following dashboard of online services:

## 2.0 Scope

### 2.1 Product Vision

RRB's vision is to provide a digital, easy to use, accessible, and secure benefits administration system for current and past railroad employees and their families to access, claim, and receive benefits while simultaneously empowering RRB staff to process and administer services in a prompt and effective manner.

### 2.2	Discovery and Nondevelopment tasks

#### 2.2.1	Service Blueprint

The contractor must develop a mapping of RRB's service ecosystem as users (internal and external) experiences it. The mapping should include all CCOSS applications starting with the Direct Deposit and Change of Address process. RRB expects the service blueprint to illustrate the current process for users and to guide the development of the digital experience and identify process improvement.

#### 2.2.2	User Research

RRB expects the contractor will work closely with RRB to perform regular user research, usability testing, and to develop and prioritize a full gamut of user stories as the project progresses. The RRB and the contractor will be a team working together to realize success. Individual user stories will be reﬁned, retracted, sub-divided, and reprioritized by the team throughout the development process. Items in the backlog must be completed by the software development team in order of priority. RRB plans to hire a federal user experience architect who will lead continued user research and will provide input on the design of CCOSS.

#### 2.2.3	Technical Discovery

RRB expects the contractor to understand, mitigate, and convey the issues and challenges of deploying custom software into RRB's production environment. Technical discovery includes (but is not limited to) understanding and documenting RRB's DevSecOps practices and the processes to obtain an Authority to Test (ATT) and Authority to Operate (ATO).

#### 2.2.4	Data Migration

We anticipate moving digital information as needed to and from legacy databases and via customer input. The data may be in different formats, schemas, and the like. Data may be extracted from source systems, profiled, cleansed, and validated with the need for data integrity (dependability and security) and data quality (accuracy, completeness, validity, consistency, uniqueness, and timeliness). For further details see section 2.8 (Personally Identifiable Information).


### 2.3	Products

We anticipate developing five distinct applications, in order of the list below (though discovery phases for later applications may overlap implementation phases for earlier applications). While section 2.3.6 (Public User Interface Improvement) does not represent an actual product, there will be development tasks associated with this work. We expect the first three products to be the simplest. Ongoing performance of the contract (i.e., exercising option periods) will be dependent on successful completion of previous products. The products will be completed one at a time and RRB anticipates the order to follow what is reflected below but is subject to change based on prioritization decisions and user research. At a minimum, RRB expects the first three products to be delivered by the contractor.

#### 2.3.1	Direct Deposit Change Form

The purpose of this product is to develop an on-line form that provides our users the ability to make changes to their direct deposit information by accessing the myRRB web portal via Login.gov for authentication/authorization. The implementation will require making API calls to different Mainframe/distributed systems to update the respective customer record with the current information submitted by the customer.

#### 2.3.2	Change of Address Form

The purpose of this product is to develop an on-line form that provides our users the ability to make changes to their address by accessing the myRRB web portal via Login.gov for authentication/authorization. The implementation will require making API calls to different Mainframe/distributed systems to update the respective user record with the current information submitted by the user.

#### 2.3.3	Tax Witholding Change

The purpose of this product is to develop an on-line form that provides our users the ability to access and make changes to their tax withholding elections by accessing the myRRB web portal via Login.gov for authentication/authorization. The implementation will require making API calls to different Mainframe/distributed systems to update the respective user record with the current information submitted by the user.

#### 2.3.4	Sickness Benefits Application

The online Sickness Benefits Application (under the RUIA) will be hosted in Azure Cloud and available as a service through the myRRB web portal that will direct the customers to the Login.gov for authentication/authorization and provide the online ability to file for sickness benefits. Furthermore, the application will provide the ability to verify the eligibility of the employee applicant, upload and verify medical statements, provide status of application process, coverage period, amount, and if disqualified, provide information about options for reconsideration.

#### 2.3.5	Customer 360 View (CRM)

This is an internal Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that allows RRB Headquarters (HQ) and Field Service Office (FSO) employees to view and update personal and benefit information for customers across all benefit areas the RRB manages in one consolidated system and interface. Customer 360 view will consolidate and integrate an individual customer’s data from various benefit systems and display the information on a single application interface.  Customer 360 view will allow HQ and FSO employees to assist customers with benefit questions in an efficient manner without the drawbacks of the current method, e.g., switching between multiple different systems and screens. The Customer 360 view will also allow HQ and FSO employees to see and update customer information at any time including when RRB is contacted by a customer through our Nationwide Toll-free System (NTFS) or other means without the need to access myRRB.gov via Login.gov. 

#### 2.3.6	Public User Interface Improvement

This improvement is for RRB’s external website that is accessed and used by  members of the public and RRB customers. Planned improvements are intended to implement OMB policy guidance titled “Delivering A Digital-First Public Experience” (OMB M-23-22) for the myRRB website.

### 2.4	Development methodology

This project will use Agile and outcome driven development principles, robust software documentation and testing, and human-centered design. RRB requires that the development process be collaborative and iterative, with open, regular, and frequent communication between RRB and the contractor.

RRB requires that the development process will consist of sprint cycles that include standard Scrum ceremonies (daily stand up, discovery/research, planning, demo/review, retrospective, etc.), discovery, and user research. The initial phases of development will focus on using iteratively delivering working software to test the hypotheses and validate assumptions in building a modernized, web-based solution for the CCOSS products in sequential order of Direct Deposit Change, Change of Address, and Tax Withholding which will be deployed to existing Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud environment.  Sickness Application, Customer 360 View, and Public User Interface Improvement are planned to be deployed to Azure cloud environment.

Even though the contractor will not be expected to support legacy systems, the contractor should have an understanding of the functionality that RRB legacy applications provide to the CCOSS Applications.

### 2.5	Working with open source

The current version-control repository designated by the RRB is Azure DevOps (ADO). The contractor will have to obtain RRB permission before delivering software under this task order that incorporates any software that is not free and open source.

The contractor must post all developed code to a version-control repository designated by the RRB. The current version-control repository designated by the RRB is Azure DevOps (ADO).

### 2.6	Product Ownership and RRB Staff Resources

RRB is in the process of hiring a government employee who will serve as the full time Product Owner for this project. In the interim, RRB has designated an interim Product Owner within RRB's technology office. 

RRB's Product Owner will:

● set product direction that aligns product work that the team conducts and how it contributes to the vision.

● manage and maintain alignment with all responsible stakeholders to:

○ convey product delivery statuses,

○ channel decisions that require stakeholder input, and

○ identify and facilitate trade-off conversations between business, stakeholder, user, technology, policy and compliance needs.

● identify and mitigate risks.

● make and document prioritization decisions.

● communicate a product roadmap broadly.

● set product goals and outcomes (measures of success)

● identify, develop, measure, and communicate goals and outcomes to stakeholders, and communicate how these measures of success contribute towards achieving the vision.

● communicate progress regarding product development and delivery via demos, weekly/bi-weekly updates, etc.

● create a 'definition of done' per the user story, iteration, release and the product levels.

● facilitate team decisions to achieve progress on delivery.

● collaborate with user research teams to gather feedback from the end users (public and internal) to help refine the product and meet user needs.

● manage and refine backlog and user stories for teams.

● support the product development team as needed.

Additional RRB subject matter experts will be available to assist in the development process.

RRB's Product Owner will set direction, make product prioritization choices, build a product roadmap, and address the business needs of the RRB, and support the other members of the development team. The contractor may be asked to assist RRB with product management.

RRB's current internal management and staffing levels are not adequate to allow for eﬀective coordination with more than one contractor development team, at least during the initial stages of the development process. If the development process goes smoothly and it appears RRB has sufficient capability, RRB may consider adding additional contractor development team(s).

### 2.7	Cloud Infrastructure and hosting

To enable modernization of CCOSS Applications, the initial work will likely be released to Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. Once this eﬀort is underway, the RRB will evaluate its needs and plan for the next milestone of the modernization. The modernization will focus on user-centered design.

RRB has determined the best approach to modernizing is to release Direct Deposit Change, Change of Address, and Tax Withholding to AWS, and transition to release Sickness Application on Azure cloud, leveraging our new knowledge of processes and tools gained along the way.

RRB, not the contractor, will be responsible for the hosting of the deployed System---as described in this document---and to obtain any necessary Authority to Operate (ATO). The contractor is required to have experience with ATO processes under the Federal Information Security Act (FISMA). RRB will determine required security controls and when they are satisﬁed. RRB will provide those security controls to the contractor as either acceptance criteria or separate user stories. The contractor must use best practices for security in delivering code.

### 2.8	Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

The government does not anticipate that contractor personnel will need to access PII data initially. RRB will provide masked production data when needed and recognizes that the masked data must be as close to production data as possible without exposing the contractor to liabilities associated with handling production data containing PII. 
However, there may be a transition period where data uploaded to the old systems will need to be synched to the new system. The transition from the legacy systems to the new system will be a partnership between the RRB and the contractor. The contractor will work closely with RRB SMEs to understand the functionality that RRB legacy applications provide to the CCOSS Applications.
Contractor personnel that must handle PII during the transition period will need to complete RRB’s security training and complete the process to obtain a federal PIV card. 

## 3.0 Objectives

### 3.1	Backlog

The preliminary product outcomes and webpage designs (Appendix 2 & 3) are the expected starting points for the development of software to be provided under this task order. This information is provided only for illustrative purposes and does not comprise the full scope or detail of the CCOSS project.

The government expects that the Contractor will work closely with the RRB Product Owner to perform regular user research and usability testing and to develop and prioritize a full gamut of user stories as the project progresses towards the capabilities for this system.

Individual user stories may be modified, added, retracted, or reprioritized by the government product owner at any time, and the government expects that the user stories will be continuously refined during the development process.  User stories should generally take the following form:

● As a <type of user> I want <to achieve some goal> so that I <fulfill a purpose>.

#### 3.1.1 Preliminary user types

● External (i.e., railroad employees / public)

○ Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) customer are retired railroad employees, their spouses and survivors (widows(er)s, children and certain other dependents), that meet eligibility requirements to receive a retirement and disability benefits. Additional details can be found in the Railroad Retirement and Survivor Benefits Informational Bulletin on rrb.gov (link: <https://www.rrb.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/2024_IB-2_web.pdf>)

○ Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) customers are railroad employees qualified to receive benefits restoring part of their lost wages arising from periods of unemployment or sickness. Additional details can be found in the Railroad Unemployment and Sickness Benefits publication UB-9 (link: <https://rrb.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/2023%20UB-9%20%28web%29.pdf>)

##### 3.1.2.6 Public Interface Improvements

Users will see an updated user interface on the RRB portal that is more user friendly and accessible in accordance with the guidelines set forth in OMB 23-22 and USWDS. This new UI/UX will enhance our existing screens, forms, and portals.

### 3.2 Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)

The government will use the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) to monitor the quality of the contractor's deliverables and performance. This oversight will help the government ensure that contractor performance reaches required levels throughout the contract term. The QASP provides the government with a proactive way to avoid unacceptable or deficient performance and provides the basis for performance ratings in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). The QASP may be updated by modification to the contract. The QASP provides the basis for performing and controlling the project's activities in accordance with the contract.

This chart sets forth the performance standards and quality levels that will apply to the code and documentation provided by and created or materially modified by the Contractor after the beginning of the period of performance. RRB will use the stated methods to assess the standard and quality levels of that code and documentation during performance.

## 4.0 Anticipated Period and Place of Performance, and Contract Type, and Budget

### 4.1 Period of Performance

The initial (base) period of performance (PoP) for this task order is six months. There will also be one option period of 6 months plus two option periods of 12 months for a total period of performance of 36 months. The PoP is expected to begin upon award.

The first two performance periods have a six month duration to allow RRB to gauge how the work is progressing and be able to end the contract if performance does not meet the requirements of this contract. However, RRB intends to exercise all option periods as long as quality performance continues, there is work to be performed, and funding is available.

Base Period (6 months):                             Upon award

Option Period 1 (6 months):                       TBD at award

Option Period 2 (12 months):                     TBD at award

Option Period 3 (12 months):                     TBD at award

### 4.2 Place of Performance

The contractor may work oﬀsite to perform the required software development services. Any work done, whether onsite or oﬀsite, must be covered by the rate agreed upon between the government and contractor. The contractor will generally be expected to be readily available during core working hours from 8:00am to 4:00pm Central time Monday through Friday and is estimated to be employed as (FTEs) full time equivalent(s). The contractor is not expected to work on federal holidays. If the federal government shuts down for any reason, contractors may seek approval from the COR to telework during this time. All work performed under this contract must be performed within the United States.

Occasional travel to government facilities may be required. Actual travel costs to government facilities will be reimbursed from the travel ODC CLIN ($2,800) in accordance with federal travel regulation. All travel must be approved by the COR prior to booking and must be submitted to the COR at least 5 business days before the requested travel date.

### 4.3 Contract Type

The anticipated contract type for this award is a Time-and-Materials (T&M) contract, to include travel as a direct-reimbursable contract line item(s). RRB will not consider quotes that include fees for licenses or subscriptions. All rates shall be fully burdened, and T&M rates are fixed at the time of award.

This contract has a total Not-To-Exceed (NTE) ceiling of $TBD for all periods of performance combined. The initial amount of incremental funding is anticipated to be $TBD

The contractor must specify whether the fixed hourly rate for each labor category applies to labor performed by:

1.  the contractor,
2.  subcontractors; and/or
3.  divisions, subsidiaries, or aﬃliates or the contractor under a common control.

### 4.4 Budget

Contractors are expected to submit a quote assuming an approximate budget of $975K for the base period (six months). The government estimates the average cost of software development under this contract to be approximately $2M per 12 month option period).

Contractors are expected to submit a quote reﬂective of its solution to fulﬁll the government's requirements. This estimate represents the services of a development team working full-time (approximately 1920 hours annually) to build an initial increment of CCOSS. This amount does not represent the government's expectation of the cost of the build in its entirety.

## 5.0 Operating Constraints (Non-functional Requirements)

### 5.1	Operating Requirements

The System must:

## 7.0 Submission Instructions and Evaluation

### 7.1	Instructions for Quotes

#### 7.1.1 Questions and Answers

[Submit all questions concerning this RFQ through this Google form]. All questions must be submitted by the deadline provided on the first page of this RFQ.

Questions should clearly express the contractors' issues or concerns and must follow the format provided in the Google form. Statements expressing opinions, sentiments, or conjectures are not considered valid inquiries and will not receive a response. Further, contractors are reminded that the government will not address hypothetical questions aimed at receiving a potential "evaluation" decision.

Answers will be provided as an amendment to the solicitation.

#### 7.1.2 Quote Submission

Quotes must be submitted using this [Google form]. The form must be completed and include the contractor's technical submission and price submission (see Appendix 5 for price submission template). You are limited to the restrictions placed on each form ﬁeld response. No paper (hard copy) offer will be accepted.

The selected awardee must register in [SAM.gov](www.sam.gov). 

Documents must be submitted following all of the following formatting guidelines. Submissions which do not conform to these standards will be rejected.

● Minimum acceptable font size is 12 pt. This is the minimum for all text --- footnotes, sidebars, etc. may not be smaller.

● Font must be Times New Roman, Calibri, or Arial.

● Narrow-width font variations (e.g. Arial Narrow) are not allowed.

● Page margins must be standard letter margins: top 0.94", bottom 0.65", left 0.78", right 0.9".

#### 7.1.3 Optional Advisory Notice

In an effort to save both the government and contractor's time and resources, this procurement will be conducted using a phased approach.

After Phase 1 submissions are evaluated (Factors 1-3), contractors will receive an advisory notice from the Contracting Officer (or delegate) via email which provides the contractors the option to participate in Phase 2.

● If all Factors in Phase 1 receive a rating of at least "Some Conﬁdence," or higher, the advisory notice will inform the contractor that they are among the most highly competitive and will be invited to participate in Phase 2 (Oral Interviews).

● If any Factor in Phase 1 receives a rating of "Low Conﬁdence," the advisory notice will inform the contractor that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.

Notwithstanding the advice provided by the Contracting Officer in response to Phase 1 submissions, contractors may elect to participate in the next phase by notifying the Contracting Officer via email. Contractors who are notiﬁed that they are not considered among the most highly viable competitive quotes, but still choose to proceed to the next phase, must notify the Contracting Officer via email not later than 24 hours after delivery of the optional advisory notice.

In making a decision to proceed regardless of being advised not to continue, please note that technical evaluation factors are in descending order of importance. Also, all technical evaluation factors, when combined, are signiﬁcantly more important than price; as non-price factors become closer, price may become more important.

All contractors must notify the Contracting Officer via email not later than 24 hours after delivery of the optional advisory notice if they choose to proceed to the next phase. Failure to notify the Contracting Officer that you choose to continue in the competition within the 24-hour period may serve as notice that the schedule holder no longer wants to be considered for the award and does not want to participate in the next phase.

### 7.2 Evaluation Factors and Quote Submission Instructions 

Quotes will be evaluated on the factors listed below. Submissions that fail to follow the RFQ instructions will be deemed nonresponsive and may result in the quote being removed from further consideration for award. Contractors are cautioned not to include assumptions, caveats, or exceptions within any part of their submission. Inclusion of assumptions, caveats, or exceptions of any kind may result in the quote no longer being considered. Contractors should ONLY submit information explicitly requested in this RFQ.

#### 7.2.1 Phase 1 - Technical Submissions

Technical submissions must be submitted using this Google form and include the following materials consist of:

● **Factor 1:** Technical Approach -seven pages maximum, including diagrams, 12-point font.

● **Factor 2:** Staffing Approach -  six pages maximum including diagrams, 12-point font (plus one additional page for each resume and one additional page for each letter of intent).

● **Factor 3:** Similar Experience - Maximum of 2 code repositories with 2-page narrative about the project for each code repository and user research plan if not included in the code repository

The oral interview does not require contractors to submit any materials.

##### 7.2.1.1 Factor 1 - Technical Approach

This section should be no more than seven pages. Written responses should be in 12-point font. Diagrams are welcomed, but must fall within the five-page limit.

The Technical Approach must explain the following:

● A proposed approach to providing the services required including the programming language(s) and frameworks and how those could integrate within the Operating Constraints (Section 5.0)

● How the contractor will develop the software in an open and agile manner including plans for user research, human centered design, and open source code

● A clear demonstration that the contractor understands the details of the project requirements including plans for providing service blueprint, technical discovery, data migration, and project management deliverables?

● Identification of potential obstacles to efficient development and plans to overcome those potential obstacles

The awardee's technical approach will become part of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) which will be included in the final contract. The PWS template is attached for reference (Appendix 6).

##### 7.2.1.2 Factor 2 - Staffing Approach

This section should be no more than six pages plus one additional page for each resume and letter of intent. Written responses should be in 12-point font and diagrams are welcomed but must fall within the page limit.

The Staffing Approach must explain the following for the base and option periods:

● Proposed approach to staffing the requirements of this project

○ How staff and resources will be allocated to accomplish project goals, objectives, and expectations

○ Plans for recruitment and retention of high-performing staff throughout the project

○ Addressing and correcting performance issues

● Titles of each of the labor categories proposed

● Proposed level of effort for each member of the contractor's team (use 1,920 hours to represent one year of full-time work, 980 hours for half time, etc.)

● Names of the individuals who will fill the key personnel roles

● Extent to which the proposed team for this project was involved in the development of the source code sample referred to in Factor 3 (Similar Experience)

● The Staffing Approach must explain the extent to which individuals on the proposed team, as a whole, will provide the relevant skills listed in section 6.3 (Skills)

Include resumes for all key personnel. The resumes must include a brief description of the experience and capability for each individual, **but cannot exceed one page in length** (and subject to the same formatting standards in the submission instructions) for each resume.

Contractors proposing key personnel who are not currently employed by the contractor or a teaming partner must include a signed letter of intent from the proposed individual who intends to participate in this project for at least one year. The letter of intent **cannot exceed one page in length each** (and subject to the same formatting standards in the submission instructions)**.**

##### 7.2.1.3 Factor 3 - Similar Experience

The contractor should demonstrate a maximum of two (2) relevant projects by submitting source code examples/repositories for each project. Along with version-controlled source code repository submissions, contractors must submit a maximum two (2) page narrative (using the formatting guidelines in Submission Instructions) for each corresponding project(s) discussing their general relevant project experience and details. The narrative shall also provide which members of the proposed team for this project were involved in the development of the submitted source code. Please provide a client point of contact (email address and telephone number) for each project submitted. Contractors may submit the same code samples that were submitted in response to the request for information (RFI).

The contractor must demonstrate similar experience by sharing one or more source code samples that provide the government evaluation team with the full revision history for all files. The contractor may submit links to Git repositories or equivalent version-controlled repositories.

For source code submissions, contractors must submit (at a minimum):

● No more than two source code samples, which must be either links to web-based repositories (either credentialed or public)

Or

● Equivalent version-controlled repositories that provide TTS with the full revision history for all ﬁles (for example, a zipped folder containing a Git-backed project, including the Git metadata)

The repositories may be public or private. If a contractor submits a link to a private source code repository, the government will provide the contractor with one or more user identities by email, and the contractor will be expected to provide the identified user(s) with access to the private source code repository within two business days. If the government is not able to obtain access within the expected milestone schedule, then the contractor will be deemed nonresponsive.

Other artifacts that would be relevant to evaluating the code sample outside of the repository may be linked within the repository.

The source code samples should be for projects that are similar in size, scope, and complexity to the project described in this RFQ. The source code must have been developed by either the contractor, a teaming partner that is proposed in response to this RFQ, or an individual that is being proposed as Key Personnel for this project.

Source code samples from recent projects involving teams of approximately four to seven full-time equivalent (FTE) personnel are preferable.

The government expects repositories to contain documentation with background information about the source code repository. Please provide only links to source code repositories in the similar experience section (Factor 3).

If a contractor wishes to submit a sample repository that was done as part of a contract award with another government agency, but lacks the necessary privileges to share with RRB, then you may provide the name of the agency, a point of contact, and a brief description of performance (less than 200 words). The government will make one request to get access as a peer government agency, but if the government is not able to obtain access to the code within the expected milestone schedule, then the contractor will be deemed nonresponsive.

**Contractors are strongly encouraged to submit sample repositories that they are capable of sharing source code rather than share one at risk of being deemed nonresponsive.**

Links provided must be to specific version-controlled repositories. (Links to an organization page listing many repositories, or to a project page where the project is made up of multiple repositories, do not qualify.)

All source code samples should be in production or be no more than six (6) months out of production. (By "in production" we mean that it should have been serving actual clients or users, not just running in an environment called "production".)

All source code samples should be

● buildable, that is, the repositories should build and run tests (for compiled languages) or only run tests (for interpreted languages), either using standard build/test commands for the language (e.g. for .NET, `dotnet test`), or using commands listed in a provided README file.

Or

● the build/test is done via containerization platform (e.g. Docker, Podman), using standard commands (e.g. docker compose up), or commands listed in a README file in the repository.

We advise applicants to build and test projects from a blank starting point before submitting repositories, as repositories that won't build or run tests may be considered detrimentally in the technical evaluation.

Each source code sample should include:

● Automated testing of the code base that can be run with standard language/framework commands (e.g. `dotnet test` for .NET, or equivalent), by or commands documented in a README file in the repository

● Evidence of the use of a continuous integration system (e.g. config files or links to CI system public pages)

● Architecture documentation

Note: If a contractor submits a link to a private Git repository (or equivalent version-controlled repository), TTS will provide the contractor with one or more GitHub user identities by email, and the contractor will be expected to provide the identiﬁed user(s) with access to the private GitHub repository within 24 hours of providing GitHub user identities. If a contractor wishes to submit a sample repository that was done as part of a contract award with another government agency, but lacks the necessary privileges to share with RRB and 18F, then you may provide the name of the agency, a point of contact, and a brief description of performance (under 200 words). The government will make one request to get access as a peer government agency, but if the government is not able to obtain access to the code within 24 hours of the request, then the contractor will be deemed nonresponsive and will be disqualiﬁed from the competition. **Contractors are strongly encouraged to submit sample repositories that they are capable of sharing source code rather than share one at risk of being deemed nonresponsive.**

If the references to source code samples provided do not include associated references to user research plans and design artifacts demonstrating how ongoing user research was incorporated into the project, then the Contractor must submit a user research plan and design artifacts relating to at least one (1) of the source code samples provided.

The plan should include the elements below:

1. A [research plan that covers the items in this template](https://github.com/18F/ux-guide/blob/master/_pages/resources/research-plan.md)

2. An interview protocol that shows your introduction, a sample of questions asked, and closing. Do not include responses.

3. A short summary of the ﬁndings of this research, why the particular research method(s) was selected, how those ﬁndings affected your work, and how your research continued after this iteration

If a research plan was submitted with the RFI, it can be submitted again, but must be uploaded with the submission. The user research plan can either be equivalent to 10 pages (8.5x11") if printed, or a link to a publicly available online resource (like a git wiki).

#### 7.2.2 Phase 2 - Oral Interviews (Factor 4) 

After the initial Phase 1 confidence assignment, contractors who receive an individual ranking of "Low Confidence" for any of the evaluation factors in Phase 1 will **not** be invited to participate in Phase 2 - Oral Interview or considered for award.

The interview associated with this RFQ does not and will not constitute discussions or negotiations as defined in FAR Part 15. Statements made during an interview will not become part of the contract. The government will not determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, nor solicit or allow revised quotes.

**Once interviews are complete, each contractor will be assigned a confidence rating for their Oral Interview.**

##### 7.2.2.1 Interview Format

Each contractor will be scheduled for a 60-minute interview with the evaluation team so the government can ask questions based on the contractor's technical submission. Contractors should also introduce the individuals on their proposed team. Lastly, the evaluation team will ask questions about the contractor's expertise relative to the project.

The Introductions phase of each interview will last no longer than five minutes. The contractor and government interview team members will introduce themselves during this time.

Each interview will include an Open Technical Session during which contractors will be asked about their technical submission (Phase 1). The government expects these interviews to assist with assessing the technical abilities of the proposed development team and to better understand the proposed technical approach described in the contractor's submission. All of the contractor's proposed Key Personnel must participate in the interview.

The Open Technical Session of each interview will last no more than 45 minutes. During this phase the contractor interview team will respond to the government's questions related to the technical aspects of the contractor's quote. Contractors will NOT be able to use or present any slides, graphs, charts, or other written presentation materials, including handouts. There will be no follow-up session for further questions from the contractor after this part of the interview.

The Closing Remarks phase of each interview will last no more than five minutes, during which the contractor may make a short presentation summarizing the contractor's responses to the government's questions.

##### 7.2.2.2 Location

The interview sessions will be conducted by video chat, though audio may be substituted as needed. The government will coordinate and set up the virtual meeting.

##### 7.2.2.3 Date and Time

After Phase 1, the government will schedule the date and time of interviews with each contractor who moved to Phase 2. The government reserves the right to reschedule any contractor's interview at the discretion of the CO.

#### 7.2.3 Phase 3: Price

Contractors shall submit their price quote using Appendix 7 via Google Form for all work, terms, and conditions described in the RFQ, QASP, and appendices. Missing or incomplete pricing data may result in the quote no longer being considered.

The government expects that the labor categories, staffing levels and total estimated hours set forth by the contractor in the pricing sheet will be consistent with the contractor's staffing plan and with their GSA Schedule contract pricing.

The contractor must specify whether the fixed hourly rate for each labor category applies to labor performed by:

1.  the contractor,
2.  subcontractors; and/or
3.  divisions, subsidiaries, or aﬃliates or the contractor under a common control.

The government anticipates awarding a time and materials (T&M) contract for this effort. The government expects the contractor's quote (including labor categories, staffing levels, and total estimated hours set forth by the contractor in the pricing sheet) to be consistent with the contractor's team structure and with their GSA Schedule contract pricing. The contractor will be compensated at fully loaded hourly rates. The evaluation team intends to evaluate quotes without discussions with contractors, and therefore the contractor's initial quote should contain the contractor's best terms.

**Contractors are required to offer discounts below GSA Schedule contract rates. When discounts are offered, quotations must clearly identify the contract rate, the discount rate, and the percentage discount for each item or labor rate being discounted.**

The contractor must provide a copy of their GSA price lists for all three years for verification of pricing. If submitting a quote as a contractor teaming arrangement (CTA), each member must submit their GSA Schedule pricing for each special item number (SIN) they are eligible to perform under. If price discounts are not provided on the GSA price list, then the contractor will be deemed unacceptable.

For contractors that do not have out-year pricing, your task order pricing may be escalated at the same percentage of your GSA multiple award schedule (MAS) contract provided you submit a copy of a valid executed modification of your GSA MAS Schedule to the CO.

The government is expecting price reductions for every rate proposed for the entire period(s) of performance. Prices will be veriﬁed to ensure they do not exceed the contractor's GSA Schedule contract price. Quotes proposing labor rates that exceed those established in the contractor's GSA contract may not be considered for award.

The government will determine total contract value by adding:

**Base Period + all Option Periods + all ODCs/OLMs = Total Contract Value**

Contractors will submit a spreadsheet detailing the labor categories, GSA Schedule Labor Category Crosswalk, contract rates, discount rates and discount percentages. This submission must not be submitted in PDF format.

The Appendix 7 (Pricing Spreadsheet Template) must be completed and returned in Excel format with formulae intact. Submission of any other price sheet may constitute a nonresponsive quote.

### 7.3 Basis of Award

Quotes must be reasonable with respect to technical approach, staffing approach, and total price. Quotes that indicate a lack of understanding of the project requirements may not be considered for award. Quotes may indicate a lack of understanding of the project requirements if the staffing plan does not use a realistic mix of labor categories and hours, or if any proposed hourly labor rates are unrealistically high or low.

The government reserves the right to review information contained in the contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) (http://www.cpars.gov/), and other applicable government systems in an effort to make an informed responsibility determination prior to award.

The government will evaluate the submitted quotes against the criteria set forth below and then make an award based on best value using tradeoffs. ~~The government intends to use a phased approach for this procurement as described below. The Government may perform a comparative evaluation (comparing offers to each other) to select the contractor that is best suited and provides the best value, considering the evaluation factors in this solicitation.~~ To be considered for award, contractors must successfully pass each phase.

Contractors are advised that the technical evaluation factors are in descending order of importance. The technical evaluation factors, when combined, are signiﬁcantly more important than price; as non-price factors become closer, price may become more important.

● Phase 1 --  Technical Submission

○ **Factor 1**:  Technical Approach

○ **Factor 2**:  Staffing Approach

○ **Factor 3**: Similar Experience (code repository and user research plan review)

● Phase 2 -  Oral Interview (**Factor 4**)

● Phase 3 -  Price Submission

Quotes that do not contain information required in the RFQ (nonresponsive) or quotes that have received a "Low Confidence" rating for any factor will no longer be considered for award. Therefore, contractors who receive a rating of "Low Confidence" in any factor in Phase 1 will **not** be invited to participate in Phase 2 - Oral Interview, contractors who receive a rating of "Low Confidence" in Phase 2 will not advance to price evaluation.\
The government will evaluate price quotes for award purposes by evaluating the hourly rate for each labor category and the overall discount provided off the contractor's GSA Schedule pricing. This will include evaluating estimated hours submitted by the contractor for the purpose of considering the estimated total cost to the government. The government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options under FAR 52.217-8 will be accomplished by using the prices offered for the last option period to determine the price for a six-month option period, which will be added to the base and other option years to arrive at the total price. Evaluation of options will not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).

The government also reserves the right to make no award.\
**NOTE: The government anticipates selecting an awardee based on initial quotes received; therefore, contractors are cautioned to submit their best price and technical quotes in the initial submission.**

### 7.4 Evaluation

#### 7.4.1 Phase 1: Factor 1 - Technical Approach

In evaluating a contractor's technical approach, the government will consider:

● Does the proposed approach include programming language(s) and frameworks and does it describe how these could integrate within the Operating Constraints (section 5.0)?

● Does the contractor describe how they will develop the software in an open and agile manner? Have they included plans for employing user research, human centered design, and open source code?

● Does the contractor demonstrate a clear understanding of the project details and goals including plans for providing service blueprint, technical discovery, data migration, and project management deliverables?

● Does the contractor identify potential obstacles to efficient development and plans to overcome those potential obstacles?

● If the contractor plans to provide services through a joint venture, teaming partner, or subcontractor, have they detailed those plans?

#### 7.4.2 Phase 1: Factor 2 - Staffing Approach

In evaluating a contractor's staffing approach, the government will consider:

● Does the contractor's staffing approach meet the requirements of this project?

● Were the titles of each of the labor categories proposed included in the staffing approach?

● Was the level of effort specified for each member of the proposed team?

● Were the names of the individuals who will fill the key personnel roles specified in the staffing plan?

● Were members of the proposed team involved in the development of the source code sample? To what extent?

● Did the proposed team, as a whole, have experience in the areas specified in section 6.3 (Skills)?

● Did the contractor include a one page resume for all key personnel proposed?

● Was a signed letter of intent included for each individual proposed as key personnel that doesn't currently work for the contractor and intends to participate in this project for at least one year?

#### 7.4.3 Phase 1: Factor 3 - Similar Experience

In evaluating a contractor's similar experience, the government will consider:

● Did the contractor provide links to version-controlled repositories for one or more source code samples that provide the full revision history for all files?

● If the contractor submitted a source code sample in a private source code repository, did the contractor provide the government with access to the repository within two business days?

● Were appropriate artifacts linked to from the repository?

● Were the submitted source code samples of a similar size, scope, type, and complexity to the project described in this RFQ?

● Was the source code sample developed by the contractor, a teaming partner that is proposed in response to this RFQ, or an individual that is being proposed as Key Personnel for this project?

● Were source code samples from recent projects involving teams of approximately four to nine full-time equivalent (FTE) personnel?

● Did the contractor submit a user research plan relating to at least one of the sample projects that included a research plan, interview protocol, and summary of findings, and was the user research plan comprehensive?

● Does the source code sample(s) generally adhere to the best practices outlined in the QASP that is included in this solicitation (Section 3.2)? Do the samples demonstrate mastery of testing code, properly styling code, accessibility, deployment, documentation, security, and incorporating user research?

In considering a contractor's similar experience, RRB may also consider information from any other source, including contractor's prior customers and public websites.

#### 7.4.4 Phase 2: Factor 4 - Oral Interview

In evaluating a contractor's Oral interview, the government will consider:

● Did the proposed Key Personnel attend and to what extent did they participate in the interview?

● Did the contractor orally contradict any part of their written response to the RFQ?

● Did the contractor demonstrate an understanding of the government's objectives?

● Did the contractor convey how they would work with the government to address any performance concerns or issues related to communication, staffing, or misalignment?

Any statements made during the oral interview that contradict the written technical submission could result in a lower confidence rating.

As stated above, the oral interview does not and will not constitute discussions or negotiations as defined in FAR Part 15. Statements made during an interview will not become part of the contract. The government will not determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, nor solicit or allow revised quotes.

#### 7.4.5 Phase 3: Price

The government will evaluate price quotes for award purposes by evaluating

● the hourly rate for each labor category,

● the overall discount provided off the contractor's GSA schedule pricing, and

● will calculate the total evaluated price by totaling the labor values of the base period, each option period (including 52.217-8 option as outlined herein), and ODCs/OLM and travel.

The government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are signiﬁcantly unbalanced.
